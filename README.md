# Sleep Posture Monitoring

Image classification and Keypoint Detection types of problems on the pressure map dataset.

## Description

This project report deals with two types of Com- puter Vision problems namely Pose Classification and Keypoint detection on the publicly available pressure map dataset. Convo- lutional Neural Networks have been used to solve these problems. The dataset has been extracted from the text files and saved as images to form a suitable type of dataset for CNN models. Apart from CNNs, K-means machine learning algorithm was used to identify the clusters formed in both raw dataset and encodings extracted from the model. The encodings and the raw dataset have been reduced to two-dimensional space by the help of PCA and t-SNE reduction algorithms. The goal of the project is to classify the sleeping postures and assess a health metric. Please see the report for detailed information.
